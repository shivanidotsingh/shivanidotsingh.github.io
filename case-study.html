  <h1>A West Oakland Story</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Context:</strong> West Oakland is going through urban development that's causing a significant impact on the existing population. The Crucible, a nonprofit industrial arts school at the heart of it, collaborated with us to visualize the impact of upcoming changes and build a story from the numbers to inform their five-year strategy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Discovery</h2>
  <p>
    We started with secondary research to understand the wide scope of changes coming to West Oakland. The proposed developments promised new opportunities but also threatened the neighborhood's identity as a center for the arts and affordable living. One project alone, the Panoramic, was expected to bring over 2,000 new residents, posing a challenge to The Crucible's mission of serving an underserved community now at risk of displacement.

  <h2>2. Development</h2>
  <p>
    We brainstormed various mediums to tell this story, from Legos and drones to podcasts. After much deliberation, we presented three core ideas to The Crucible: a layered map, a storyboard, and a playful game. The client was most drawn to the game idea, which could make complex, high-stakes information more approachable.

  <h2>3. Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    We developed a prototype based on Monopoly, a fitting metaphor for the real-estate gentrification West Oakland was facing. Feedback on our first version was invaluable; we learned the gravity of the situation was being lost. We iterated by placing a rendering of the future 7th street at the center of the board and redesigned our "impact cards" to visually emphasize the hard-hitting consequences of gentrification.

  <h2>4. Digital Extension</h2>
  <p>To expand the reach of our prototype, we also designed a digital version of the game. Below is a video of the interaction with the digital prototype.</p>
