  <h1>The ABC’s of designing a preschool</h1>

  <p>
When a friend decided to start her own preschool out of a bungalow in Chennai, she reached out to Jyothi and me to workout the naming and branding.We set out to visually define what learning looks like for two to five year olds. We were tasked with naming and defining the visual language for a preschool.
We reframed our opportunity statement as, 'How might we design the identity of a preschool to reflect an inclusive learning experience?'
<br><br>
The naming went through one iteration with the stakeholders, and we all resonated with the phonetic and cultural relevance of a cheeky name like Elemenopy (L-M-N-O-P).
For the logo and identity, we presented the 3 routes, and ultimately picked one that was a simple play of shapes derived from the alphabet, since it perfectly complemented the ‘learning basics’ philosophy that the name intended.
We were all on the same page, about creating a sense of belonging and comfort for the children, with all the brand communication and these shapes seemed to provide the flexibility to do that. The shapes are a careful abstraction of the letters themselves, that take on many meanings across communication collaterals, effortlessly. The colour palette and font specifics were defined soon after, and an array of examples can be found below.  </p>

  <p>
We went on to explore options for mottoes, tag-lines and philosophies that the pre-school stands for. We did some secondary research on montessori principles of education and adapted a version of teaching a child ‘how to learn rather than what to learn.‘ For the website, we decided to name the five stages of learning in the preschool starting with L-M-N-O-P respectively — Little Learners, Meaning Makers, Nifty Newbies, Observers and Pioneers. The core creative guideline of the brand, both internal and external, remained grounded with the rhetorical and catchy ‘Seek, Solve, Share’.
Overall it has been one of the more fulfilling projects that I have helped bring to life, and I enjoy watching it grow.
