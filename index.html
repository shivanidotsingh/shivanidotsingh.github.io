  <p>Hi, I’m Shivani. A designer with an aptitude for analytical thinking and an appetite for play.
    Currently working at UNICEF Innovation where we shape tech for social impact, I see my work as a way to bridge intention and outcome.
    As a graphic designer, I’ve previously worked in visual communication and advertising.
